# Acme Product Management System

## Introduction:
Welcome to the Acme Product Management System! This project is designed to help organize and manage the vast inventory of products sold by Acme Corporation. With this system, you can model different types of products, generate random products for inventory, and generate reports summarizing the inventory.

## Requirements:
To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. Additionally, ensure that you have the following modules available:
- pytest
- random (from the Python standard library)

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/acme-product-management.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd acme-product-management
    ```

## Usage:
1. **acme.py**: This file contains the `Product` and `BoxingGlove` classes for modeling products sold by Acme Corporation. It also includes methods for calculating stealability, explosion risk, and specific functionality for boxing gloves.
